Introduction:
I created this interactive bar chart for my reader to know the players height distribution. And I wanna show the relationship between players height and their HR, so I created scatter plot.

Design:
Since the players can be classified as 3 group, they are Right hand, Left hand, and both hands.
So the interactive part is about a dropdown list for reader to choose the group they are interested in. 

Feedback:
The most challenging part is update the chart, because we have to select the right element and delete the old connected data. Afterward, we can build the new chart with new data again. Since the data connecting part is really confused, so I spent lots of time to study it.
